// fizzBuzz is a common interview problem but is usually done with a 'for loop' and not recursively.
// Create a recursive fizzBuzz. If you are unfamiliar, fizzBuzz loops through 1 - 100 and prints either
// 'fizz', 'buzz', 'fizzbuzz', or the number itself.
// If a number is divisible by 3, print 'fizz'.
// If a number is divisible by 5, print 'buzz'.
// If a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print 'fizzbuzz'.
// Otherwise print the number itself.

// Write a function, lucasNumber(n), that takes in a number.
// The function should return the n-th number of the Lucas Sequence.
// The 0-th number of the Lucas Sequence is 2.
// The 1-st number of the Lucas Sequence is 1
// To generate the next number of the sequence, we add up the previous two numbers.
//
// For example, the sequence begins: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, ...
//
// Solve this recursively!
//
// Examples:
//
// lucasNumber(0)   // => 2
// lucasNumber(1)   // => 1
// lucasNumber(2)   // => 3
// lucasNumber(3)   // => 4
// lucasNumber(5)   // => 11
// lucasNumber(9)   // => 76

// sumArray([5])            // => 5
// sumArray([5, 2])         // => 7

// makeChange(100, [0,0,0,0]) ==> [4, 0, 0, 0]
